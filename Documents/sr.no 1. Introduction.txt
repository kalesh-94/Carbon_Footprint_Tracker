1) Introduction :-

The Carbon Footprint Tracker is a web-based tool designed to help individuals measure and analyze their personal carbon emissions. 
Many people are unaware of how their daily activities—such as transportation, energy consumption, food habits, and waste management—contribute to environmental pollution. This project provides a simple and interactive platform for users to estimate their carbon footprint and receive actionable insights to reduce their impact on the environment.

2) Problem Statement :-

Climate change is a growing global concern, with carbon emissions being a major driver of environmental degradation. 
While industries are regulated for their emissions, individual contributions remain largely untracked, leading to unintentional but significant environmental harm. Most people lack accessible tools to measure their daily carbon emissions, making it difficult to take informed steps toward sustainability. A user-friendly tracking system is needed to create awareness and encourage eco-friendly habits.

3) Solution :-

The Carbon Footprint Tracker is built using Streamlit and Flask/Django to offer an interactive and real-time estimation of an individual's carbon emissions. Users enter details about their daily activities, and the system calculates their footprint based on scientific emission factors. The platform provides:
✅ Real-time carbon footprint estimation
✅ Category-wise breakdown (transport, energy, food, waste, shopping)
✅ Data visualizations for better insights
✅ Personalized recommendations to reduce emissions
✅ A simple, lightweight web interface for easy access

This tool empowers individuals to track, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint, making sustainability more achievable for everyone.
